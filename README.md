# PixelMappingDj
Control lights with video, no programming needed. Runs on Windows, Linux, iOS and Raspberry Pi!

Hi,
let me introduce new open source software for light designers I have programmed - PixelMappingDj that I would love to see used in your project. Similar software (Madrix, Resolume Arena to name a few) usually costs lots of money, it needs particular platform to run on and it is proprietary, which can become a problem when you have custom lights that does not fit in the predefined fixture pattern.  


PixelMappingDJ is **open source** software for Pixel Mapping - **controlling light fixtures** (think led strips, dmx lights..) **with video**. That means **you do not have to program anything** - you only need to be able to edit video or use existing one to create infinite number of effects. It was completely programmed using [**Processing**](https://processing.org/ "**Processing**") Java so you can easily modify it. It uses **Artnet** for communication, ControlP5 for GUI and GL Video and Video libraries. It runs on **Windows, Linux, iOS and Raspberry Pi** where it uses hardware acceleration.

I am also **offering paid support** and modifications to software to suit your needs if you do not want to do it yourself - contact me at info@trackmeifyoucan.com. On the other hand all **contributions are welcomed** and appreciated.
